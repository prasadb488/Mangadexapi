Console logs, inspecting CsS and that's fine but chrome DevTools can do so much more. So in this video I'm going to show you 14 DevTools features that will help you work faster, stay in flow and make your debugging experience a lot smoother.

You can scan per block which is faster or per function which is more detailed. For example I can see that a huge chunk of this biggest JavaScript file, almost 98% is completely unused on initial load. And it's not just this one. Several other files are only partially used too. And the best part, this updates live as you interact with the page. If I click for example on something, you see new numbers. This tool makes it super easy to figure out.\"}, {'chunk': 'chunk_150_180.mp4', 'text': \" which parts of your code or third-party libraries could be lazy loaded or maybe even removed entirely, and that way you can seriously cut down your website size.

For example, if I want to know why the CSS class of this list is changing.\"}, {'chunk': 'chunk_180_210.mp4', 'text': \" I can right-click the node, go to breakon, and choose attribute modifications. I can also select sub-tree modifications and node removal if I want to catch any kind of change to that element. And now you'll see a breakpoint appear in the DOM panel on the left.

The better solution is in the rendering tab. There you'll find a checkbox called emulate a focused page, and it does exactly that. The website thinks it's still focused, even though you're clicking around in the dev tools. It's a tiny feature, but I use it all the time. And why we are already in the rendering tab.

Really helpful practical insights that help you tidy up your CSS code. I take a lot of screenshots every day for myself, for colleagues, for friends, whatever, but sometimes you just want to capture a specific part of a website as an image. And with Chrome DevTools, that's super easy. Just right click on any note and choose capture node screenshot. That will save an image of exactly that element. Pretty handy, but sure most screenshots.\"}, {'chunk': 'chunk_390_420.mp4', 'text': \" tools can do that too. But here's where it gets more interesting. If you want a screenshot of the entire page and doesn't fit on your screen so normally you'd have to stitch several screenshots together you can just right-click the body element and hit capture node screenshot.

If you're in the middle of development and want to pause your code in the browser, you don't always have to set a manual breakpoint in the DevTools.

You probably know that you can run JavaScript in the console. That's pretty standard. But if you have little scripts that you use regularly, you can actually save them as snippets.

Just for yourself. By the way if you're interested in building a real Chrome extension, I've got a separate video explaining how to do that. Snippets are stored persistently in the browser so they won't disappear. The only downside is to run them you always need to open the dev tools and trigger them manually. They don't run automatically.\"}, {'chunk': 'chunk_600_630.mp4', 'text': \" or anything like that. And here's one last quick tip before we wrap up. If the dev tools are open and you want to clear the cache for a page, just long-click the reload button in Chrome. You'll see three options, a normal reload, a hard reload, and one to empty the cache and do a hard reload. Super handy and something I use all the time. And that's it for this video. I really hope you found it helpful. Let me know your thoughts in the comments. And if you enjoyed it, I'd really appreciate a like and a subscription. It helps me a ton to making videos like this. Thank you so much.\"}, {'chunk': 'chunk_60_90.mp4', 'text': \" Just copy it out, super smooth. When debugging JavaScript, most of us still throw in console lock statements all over the place. But that's not really necessary. In the DevTools in the Sources panel, right-click next to a line number and choose at Lockpoint.

Besides break points and lock points, you can also set conditional break points. That way your code only passes when a specific condition is true. Great for tracking down sneaky bucks and not spamming your console while debugging. What of my absolute favorite features? Go to the three dot menu, more tools, coverage.
